## What is documentation?

Documentation of a component refers to a set of written materials that provide
information about the component's features, functionality, and usage. This can
include technical specifications, user manuals, installation guides, release
notes, API documentation, and other relevant information.


## Why its required?

Documentation is essential for software development, as it helps developers
understand how a component works, how to integrate it with other components,
and how to troubleshoot issues. It also helps end-users understand how to use
the component effectively.

Well-written documentation should be comprehensive, accurate, and easy to
understand. It should provide clear instructions on how to use the component
and how to resolve any issues that may arise. Additionally, documentation
should be kept up-to-date and revised whenever there are changes to the
component.
